### Overview

Clink combines the native Windows shell **cmd.exe** with the powerful command line editing features of the GNU Readline library, which provides rich completion, history, and line-editing capabilities. Readline is best known for its use in the well-known Unix shell Bash, the standard shell for Mac OS X and many Linux distributions.

3. To establish Clink to an existing cmd.exe process, use "&lt;install_dir&gt;\clink.exe inject"

### Extending Clink

Clink can be extended through its Lua API which allows easy creation context sensitive match generators, prompt filtering, and more. More details can be found in Clink's documentation which can be found [here](https://github.com/mridgers/clink/blob/master/docs/clink.md).

### Building Clink

Clink's uses [Premake](http://premake.github.io) to generate Visual Studio solutions or makefiles for MinGW. Note that Premake >= 5.0-alpha12 is required.

1. Cd to your clone of Clink.
2. Run "premake5.exe &lt;toolchain&gt;" (where "&lt;toolchain&gt;" is one of Premake's actions - see "premake5.exe --help")
3. Build scripts will be generated in ".build\\&lt;toolchain&gt;\". For example; .build\vs2013\clink.sln.
4. Call your toolchain of choice (VS, mingw32-make.exe, msbuild.exe, etc). GNU makefiles (Premake's *gmake* target) have a **help** target for more info.
